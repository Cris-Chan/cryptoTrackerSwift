# cryptoTrackerSwift
This is an app i made on the side to practice my swift programming,
it keeps track of the values of BTC ETH and LTC. 
It does not have constraints set up so the only phone it work with is the iphoneX, This will be fixed in later versions :)

--------FUTURE----------
* display graphs on coin/token history
* support notification center
* more professional design
* add constraints to support multiple ios devices
* provide feedback that data is refreshing when refresh button is pressed
